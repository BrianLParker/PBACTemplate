# Permission Based Access Control (PBAC)

### WIP 
This project is a work in progress. Features and implementations may change.

This repository will contain a template for implementing Permission Based Access Control (PBAC) in .NET 10 Blazor applications. PBAC is a flexible and scalable approach to managing user permissions based on specific actions and resources.
